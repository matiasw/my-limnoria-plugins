List users from a set of channels that the bot is on in an HTML file called userlist.html. This list is also output as JSON into userlist.json. The channels are set with the "channels" configuration variable, which should be given as a space-separated list of channel@network format channel identifiers. A style sheet for the generated page can be set with the "stylesheet" configuration variable - set to "none" to disable. 

This plugin was created for the use of the multi-network channel #buddhism: https://buddhism-chat.org/

May limitless beings benefit.
